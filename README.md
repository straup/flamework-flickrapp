First of all, this doesn't actually do anything. Especially the OAuth stuff
which is still being written and tested.

Secondly, it is an attempt to write replacement pages (and libraries) for
Flamework so that all auth and login magic is handled using the Flickr API as a
single sign-on provider.

Essentially like this: https://github.com/straup/gae-flickrapp
